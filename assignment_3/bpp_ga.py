Project Description:
SwiftShip, an e-commerce company, processes hundreds of customer orders daily. Each order consists of items with
varying weights, and each shipping box has a maximum weight capacity of 10 kg and can carry multiple items
(orders). Due to rising packaging and courier costs, SwiftShip wants to minimize the total number of boxes used,
while ensuring that no box exceeds its weight limit.
